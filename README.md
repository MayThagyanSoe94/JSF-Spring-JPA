# JSF-Spring-JPA
This project showcases a web application developed using JavaServer Faces (JSF) for the front-end, Spring Framework for the back-end, and Java Persistence API (JPA) for database interactions. As a junior developer, I built this project to deepen my understanding of full-stack development with Java EE technologies.
